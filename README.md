## Wolframalpha Telegram Bot

Get a wolframalpha id and a telegram bot token and then replace the following lines in the code to make it work:

```python
token = "YOUR TELEGRAM BOT TOKEN HERE"
wolframId = "YOUR WOLFRAMALPHA ID HERE"
```

This bot gets the input as a normal message and sends the step by step solution provided by the wolframalpha as the response.
